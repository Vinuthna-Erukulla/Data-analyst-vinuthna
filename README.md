Project Description

This project focuses on building a comprehensive Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for the City of Vancouver to analyze and visualize key urban datasets. The goal is to facilitate data-driven decision-making across various domains, such as cultural spaces, public art installations, city-owned assets, and street infrastructure. By employing descriptive and exploratory analyses, the project seeks to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights to support urban planning and resource optimization.

Project Title: "Data Analytics for the City of Vancouver: Unlocking Urban Insights Using AWS Cloud Solutions"

Dataset

The project utilizes diverse datasets related to urban planning and infrastructure:

1) Cultural Spaces:

Type, ownership (private, government, non-profit), location, and square footage.
Missing values in key columns like Square_Feet to be imputed during cleaning.

2) Public Art Installations:

Material used, year of installation, and neighborhood locations.
Patterns in material preferences and installation trends.

3) City-Owned Assets:

Geographic locations and building counts in various neighborhoods.
Ownership distribution across different city areas.

4) One-Way Streets:

Street types (arterial vs. non-arterial) and geospatial distributions.
Usage analysis based on traffic and neighborhood access.

Methodology
The analysis follows a systematic approach leveraging AWS services and data analytics techniques:

1) Data Ingestion:

Datasets are uploaded to AWS S3 for storage and scalability.
Raw and cleaned data are stored in separate buckets for clear organization.
